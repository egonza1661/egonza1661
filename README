What is MBSniffer?
----------------

MBSniffer is a free Qt-based implementation of a serial ModBus RTU traffic decoder.
A graphical user interface allows an easy bus monitor for sniffing all
traffic on the bus.

At this point, the program works on linux. It's been tested with a speed of 115200 Bauds.
It needs to be build and tested in Windows (next step).

As I stepped away from windows long time ago, I gratefully take any help on this behave.



Requirements
------------

* Qt5
* GCC



Building
--------

See INSTALL for information on how to build MBSniffer.
